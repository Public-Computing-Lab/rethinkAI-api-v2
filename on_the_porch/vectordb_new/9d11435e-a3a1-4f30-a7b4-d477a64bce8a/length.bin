A lot of people want to change. People don't want to keep waking up every day like, Yo, how am I going to make some money today? Am I going to make it home? Hugging your family, hugging your kids like, you know, praying that you can make it back home. You know, it's good in the neighborhood, people do want to change, but if Ain't nobody you know stepping up, showing them it's not going to happen.u
